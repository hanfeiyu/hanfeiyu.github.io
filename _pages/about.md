## About Me

* Greetings! I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Division of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.lsu.edu/eng/cse/), at [Louisiana State University](https://www.lsu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Hao Wang](https://www.haow.ca/).
* I received my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Systems at [University of Washington Tacoma](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/), advised by Prof. [Wes J. Lloyd](http://faculty.washington.edu/wlloyd/index.html) and Prof. [Athirai A. Irissappane](https://sites.google.com/view/athirai/home?authuser=0). I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electronic Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).
* My research interests lie in **Cloud Computing** and **Machine Learning**. Specifically, I'm focusing on applying machine learning such as reinforcement learning to improve serverless computing and building better systems for serving machine learning. I also had a little work on **Natural Language Processing**.
