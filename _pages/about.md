# About Me

* Greetings! I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.stevens.edu/school-engineering-science/departments/electrical-computer-engineering), at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/), advised by Prof. [Hao Wang](https://intellisys.haow.us/haowang/).
* I received my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Systems at [University of Washington Tacoma](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/), advised by Prof. [Wes J. Lloyd](http://faculty.washington.edu/wlloyd/index.html) and Dr. [Athirai A. Irissappane](https://sites.google.com/view/athirai/). I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electronic Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).
* I was a Research Intern at [Microsoft Azure Research Systems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/azure-research-systems/), working on improving the performance and resource efficiency of container platforms.
* My research interests lie in **Serverless Computing**, **Large-Scale AI/ML Systems**, **LLM Serving Systems**, **Reinforcement Learning Systems**, and **Cloud Computing**. I develop efficient serverless AI ecosystems that integrate cloud and HPC resources to optimize large-scale AI workloads:
  * \[[VLDB'25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3696435.3696441), [SC'24 (<span style="color:red">*Best Student Paper Finalist*</span>)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/SC41406.2024.00045), [AAAI'24](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/29592)\] Accelerated and cost-effective large-scale *distributed DRL systems* on serverless computing  
  * \[[SoCC'24 (<span style="color:red">*Best Paper Award*</span>)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3698038.3698509), [In-submission-1](https://hanfeiyu.github.io/publications/), [In-submission-2](https://hanfeiyu.github.io/publications/)\] Accelerated serverless inference of *Deep Learning*, *Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)*, and *Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)* systems   
  * \[[ASPLOS'24](https://doi.org/10.1145/3617232.3624871), [TPDS'24](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682062), [HPDC'23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3588195.3592996), [WWW'22](https://doi.org/10.1145/3485447.3511979), [ACSOS'21](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9659513)\] Efficient resource management and function scheduling for *serverless computing systems*  
  * \[[In-submission-3](https://hanfeiyu.github.io/publications/)\] Memory-efficient *MoE-based LLM* serving systems  
* I'm the recipient of various academic awards, including [**SoCC'24 Best Paper Award**](https://hanfeiyu.github.io/files/socc24-best-paper.pdf) and [**SC'24 Best Student Paper Finalist**](https://sc24.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=pap594&sess=sess392). I was selected as one of the [**2025 ML and Systems Rising Stars**](https://mlcommons.org/about-us/programs/).
