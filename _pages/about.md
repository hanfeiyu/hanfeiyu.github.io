# About Me

* Greetings! I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Division of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.lsu.edu/eng/cse/), at [Louisiana State University](https://www.lsu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Hao Wang](https://intellisys.haow.ca/haowang/).
* I received my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Systems at [University of Washington Tacoma](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/), advised by Prof. [Wes J. Lloyd](http://faculty.washington.edu/wlloyd/index.html) and Prof. [Athirai A. Irissappane](https://sites.google.com/view/athirai/). I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electronic Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).
* My research interests lie in
  - Cloud Computing
  - Machine Learning
  - ML for Systems
  - Systems for ML
* Specifically, I'm focusing on applying learning techniques to improve **serverless computing** and building serverless systems for **ML training/serving**.
