# Anime

* I'm a huge fan of [Anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime). In my spare time, I enjoy watching animes, especially those produced by [Kyoto Animation](https://www.kyotoanimation.co.jp/en/). I use [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/ChiChiChitanda) and [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/11039384/bangumi) to track the animes that I completed (my Bilibili is most likely to be up-to-date).
* Sometimes, I would chat with people on [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/) to practice my English and Japanese speakings as well as making new friends online. In order to watch those animes without subtitles, I enforced myself to pass [JLPT N2](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/levelsummary.html) through self-learning.
* I like to play the OP (opening) and ED (ending) songs of animes that I watched on my playlist, which brings me back to the days when I was watching them ([Proust Effect](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199685875.001.0001/acprof-9780199685875)).

# Music

* My favorite singer is [Hatsune Miku (初音ミク)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku), who is a virtual singer developed from [Vocaloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid). My favorite song of Hatsune Miku is [愛言葉III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WptXk39wiIQ), check the song if you are interested.

# Game

* I love video games in the broad area of PC, mobile, and console games.
* I played [DOTA](https://www.dota2.com/home) and [StarCraft](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/) for over 7 years. For DOTA, I'm good at mid and safe lanes. For StarCraft, I'm a [Terran](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Terran) player (TIMBA!).
* I'm a fan of [Nintendo Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch) and [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) series.
