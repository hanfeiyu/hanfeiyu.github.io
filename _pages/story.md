# Animes

* I'm a huge fan of [**Anime**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime). In my spare time, I enjoy watching animes, especially those produced by [Kyoto Animation](https://www.kyotoanimation.co.jp/en/). I use [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/ChiChiChitanda) and [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/11039384/bangumi) to record all animes that I completed (my Bilibili is most likely to be the latest).
* Sometimes, I would chat with people on [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/) to practice my English and Japanese speakings as well as making new friends online. In order to watch those animes without subtitles, I enforced myself to pass [JLPT N2](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/levelsummary.html) by self-learning.
* I like to play the OP (opening) and ED (ending) songs of animes that I watched on my playlist, which brings me back to the days when I was watching them.

# Games

* I love video games in the broad area of PC, mobile, and console games.
* I played [DOTA](https://www.dota2.com/home) and [StarCraft](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/) over 7 years. For DOTA, I'm good at mid and safe lanes. For StarCraft, I'm a [Terran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Races_of_StarCraft#Terran_factions) player.
* Recently, I became a fan of [Nintendo Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch) and got an Animal Crossing Edition of it.
